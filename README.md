# Rascal Tutor

The Rascal tutor is a pre-processor that generates Markdown files from the following input:
* Markdown files structured in a hierarchical folder structure
* Rascal files, as nested in their package structure

The tutor is used to:
* generate source code examples with their input and output
* cross-link between concepts in the same course hierarchy, and between course hierarchies

It has some other bells and whistles that make it easy to write documentation
for Rascal libraries and projects. 

The tutor is linked with [Rascal Maven Plugin](https://github.com/usethesource/rascal-maven-plugin)
for easy integration into your projects.
